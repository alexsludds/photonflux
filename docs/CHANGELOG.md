# [CHANGELOG](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## 0.2.1
- Added example of PN junction MZI
- Added simulations for vertical junctions, U-shaped junctions, MOSCAP junctions. Interleaved junction to come soon.
- Removed lumerical simulation files from pypi distribution
- Removed .mat files from pypi distribution (they are generated as a byproduct of lumerical simulations)

- Updated junction file naming convention.

## 0.1.1
- Added simulation files for straight pn junction
- Updated organization of components to put related files in folders

## 0.1.0
